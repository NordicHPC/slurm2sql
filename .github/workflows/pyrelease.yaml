name: PyPI release

# Make a PyPI release.  This action:
# - builds the release files
# - checks the tag version matches the source version
# - releases on PyPI using the action

# This uses an action I made that tries to automatically verify the
# release version matches the tag version.  If you don't use tags,
# then remove that part.  The module name can be configured with
# MOD_NAME below.

# The upload uses a "trusted publisher".  Configure PyPI so that it
# knows to accept incoming request from GitHub (no extra auth
# configuration here is needed)
# https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/using-a-publisher/




# If MOD_NAME not defined, infer it from the current directory.  If
# inferred from the directory, '-' is replaced with '_'.  This is used
# when checking the version name.
